* While cursor is over a placard, hold down the left mouse button in order to move the placard in 3D space. There is no known use for this feature.
* Use the up/down and left/right cursor keys to move around the grid 
* Set the highlighted placard to any placard in the third (industry sector) column and press enter key. 
* Display will redraw and display constituents in that sector only.

### Notes

* The scrollable list of constituent data under the title is just for debugging
* The current data set is just a 2D grid. An imminent future release will add daily trading data for, say, the previous month. 
The display of this data will use the third dimension
* Future releases will add the ability for the display to update camera position as you scroll up and down
