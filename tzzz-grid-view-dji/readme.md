[Dow Jones Industrial Average ~ Wikipedia]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average )

This demo presents a subset of the data of the data in the S&P 500 data set.
You might use this data set in preference to the S&P 500 data set if your computer has trouble dealing with the very heavy computer requirements

### Usage

* While cursor is over white space, hold down your left mouse button and drag to rotate the model
* Use the mousewheel to zoom in and out
* While cursor is over white space, hold down your right mouse button and drag to pan the model
* Move mouse cursor over any 'placard' in order to highlight that placard
* Use the up/down and left/right cursor keys to move around the grid 
* Set the highlighted placard to any placard in the third (industry sector) column and press enter key. 
* Display will redraw and display constituents in that sector only. 
	* With the DJI, most sectors have only one or two constituents
	* These may be hidden off the top of the screen
* Select a placard in any other column and press enter to display all the constituents
* Click underlined title to reload. This action also resets the display
* Colors indicate industry sector

### Notes

* The scrollable list of constituent data under the title is just for debugging

### Road Map

* Draw sectors from the middle of the screen, not the top
* The current data set is just a 2D grid. An imminent future release will add daily trading data for, say, the previous month. 
The display of this data will use the third dimension
* Add the ability for the display to update camera position as you scroll up and down
