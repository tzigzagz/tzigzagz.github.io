### Usage

* Use the mousewheel to zoom in and out
* While cursor is over white space, hold down your right mouse button and drag to pan the model
* Move mouse cursor over any 'placard' in order to highlight that placard
* While cursor is over a placard, hold down the left mouse button in order to move the placard in 3D space. There is no known use for this feature.
* Use the up/down and left/right cursor keys to move around the grid 
* Set the highlighted placard to any placard in the third (industry sector) column and press enter key. 
* Display will redraw and display constituents in that sector only. 
* Select a placard in any other column and press enter to display all the constituents
* Click underlined title to reload. This action also resets the display
* Colors indicate industry sector

### Notes & Road Map

* The scrollable list of constituent data under the title is just for debugging
* The current data set is just a 2D grid. An imminent future release will add daily trading data for, say, the previous month. 
The display of this data will use the third dimension
* Future releases will add the ability for the display to update camera position as you scroll up and down 
* The S&P 500 is a very [heh, heh] rich source of data. There are may sources and many possible ways of remixing data.
	* For example: how should and could the grid views talk to the stick views?
