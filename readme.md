Ted's tZigZagZ Read Me
===


This web site may be considered as the lab equipment for thought experiments expressed by Ted Nelson.

It is a work-in-progress being built in the hope that Ted, in looking at the various widgets and effects shown here, might say:
"That thing is heading a direction I am interested in pursuing. Now can you make them thorgle and wimpser?" - or whatever.

The font used everywhere is Courier. It's the fixed-space font programmers use.  
The experiments tend to have an over-exuberance of color. It's the opposite of the the black and white programmers use.

So it goes.
